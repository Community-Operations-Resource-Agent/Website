            <p>
              Since the launch of Project CORA and the creation of CORAbot, we
              have presented their work at various During these presentations,
              we have received reoccurring questions about the framework
              supporting CORA and the project’s longevity. More information can
              be found below.

              Is CORAbot only for COVID or can I use it for other supplies?
            </h3>
            <p>
              CORAbot can be used for any community purpose. Whether it is
              finding employment resources to mental health services, CORAbot is
              here to help. The technology used to create CORAbot is open
              sourced so any NGO or advocate specific to a cause, can create a
              resource that will help them in their work

            <h3>What kind of languages do you support?</h3>
            <p>
              CORAbot, with its natural language SMS text bot, is fluent in more
              than 60 languages. It interacts with vetted organizations to track
              and match supplies they have available to help those in need,
              orchestrating fulfillment in a manner that preserves the privacy
              of everyone involved.

            <h3>What organizations have already deployed the solution?</h3>
            <p>
              Our partner, Team Rubicon, has deployed “Agent Remi” to help
              assist with their direct volunteer effort. Based on CORAbot’s
              structure, “Agent Remi” is the first of many examples in how
              CORAbot can be adapted for an organization’s specific cause. The
              Project CORA accelerator is on Github with shareable code and we
              will work with several NGOs (starting with Team Rubicon) and use
              it to help their constituents.

            <p>
              There are others helping in the pandemic who can also use help.
              We’ve been talking with GetUsPPE.org as well as a team working
              with hospitals in the UK. We are also continuing to work with Real
              Escape from Sex Trade (REST) and will leverage some of our
              improvements back into their model, as they are facing some
              extreme and resource shortages, and their bot (TIRA) helps
              understand available needs and resources.

            <h3> How will you keep the users’ data private? </h3>
            <p>
              Privacy is one of our key design principles and we wired it into
              the technology wherever possible as well as in the deployment
              approach. We share as little information as is necessary and only
              with permission from the people who own it, putting them in
              control of their own data. For example, a background checked TR
              volunteer can receive an address to drop groceries at, but they
              get no additional information about the recipient and their needs.
              Our bot is the intermediary that protects users’ privacy.

            <h3>What about accessibility?</h3>
            <p>
              We want CORAbot to help as many people as possible.This is why we
              are looking at speech to text capabilities, and text to speech so
              that our bot can communicate with anyone. We are also looking at
              IVR phone systems for those who dial in from a landline or a
              payphone.

            <h3>Is it okay if I take the solution and sell it?</h3>
            <p>
              No. The Project CORA team created CORAbot to assist with NGO
              efforts in mind. The goal is to create an open sourced community
              of technology where NGOs and other advocates can use the
              genericized information and adapt it to their cause. We want
              CORAbot to be a free and accessible resource to everyone.
